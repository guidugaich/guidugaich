# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Guilherme, I am from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and I'm a software developer, always looking to learn and build cool stuff. I have a background in economics and finance and currently working as a trainee developer at [Remessa Online](https://www.remessaonline.com.br/).

I am focused on back-end technologies such as Node.js and Python. I can work with both SQL and NoSQL databases and also with cloud services such as AWS. I can also deal with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as the React framework. I'm always looking to improve my knowledge on the fundamentals of computer science like algorithms and data structures.

I can work well in a team and navigate well in product discussions. I'm always curious to learn whatever is needed to build a great digital product for customers.
